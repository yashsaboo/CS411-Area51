Crime Map Visualizer
This repo contains team Area51's crime map visualizer project for CS411, taught by Prof. Alawini in the Spring of 2020.

How CSV Files Were Created:
We got the PDFs of the crimes committed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 2013 - 2019
We converted the above dataset from .pdf to .doc files via this website
We copied the data of each .doc file to a new excel spreadsheet and cleaned the spreadsheet (to remove the page breaks)
Lastly, we exported the excel files to .csv files
